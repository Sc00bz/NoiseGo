# Noise Implementation in Go

This is a **readable** implementation of the Noise Protocol Framework.

I have tried to respect the Noise specification as much as possible.

## Go's conventions

* Golang doesn't use snake_case, but Noise does.
* Golang capitalize function names to make them public, Noise does it for different reasons.
